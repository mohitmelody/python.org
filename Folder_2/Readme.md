# **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python** is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to create classes and objects, enabling more organized and reusable code. A **class** serves as a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and behavior. For instance, a class can represent a real-world entity like a `Car`, with attributes such as `color` and `model`, and methods like `drive` and `brake`. An **object** is an instance of a class, embodying the properties and functionalities defined by the class. **Polymorphism** allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling flexibility and reuse. **Inheritance** lets a class inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships. **Encapsulation** ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside, exposing only necessary parts through methods. This modular approach not only makes the code more manageable and scalable but also aligns with real-world problem-solving by modeling complex systems as interacting objects. #
